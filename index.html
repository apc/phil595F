<p><span class="post-date">September 15, 2014 </span><br> There is a typo in the last problem of the <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/pluginfile.php/778483/mod_resource/content/2/595F.pset1.pdf">first problem set</a>. If you figured out what the typo is, you will get bonus points. But if you did not, or if you found yourself unable to prove what I asked you to, you will not be penalized. Thanks to Patrick for pointing this out to me.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 14, 2014 </span><br> It came to my attention that problem 4 on the <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/pluginfile.php/778483/mod_resource/content/2/595F.pset1.pdf">first problem set</a> is also one of the statements on p. 14 of <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/strevens/BCT/BCT.pdf">Strevens’ <em>Notes</em></a>. You should feel free to just skip problem 4, or to refer to your earlier proof. Thanks to Victor for pointing this out.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 07, 2014 </span><br> There was a typo in the problem set I first posted. The typo has been corrected as of 11:30 AM.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 07, 2014 </span><br> The first problem set is now available on the <a href="./assignments.html">assignments</a> page. It is due on September 16.</p>
