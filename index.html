<p><span class="post-date">September 23, 2014 </span><br> And another typo! This time, thanks are due to Lu for bringing this to my attention. The typo was in problem 4. <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=588361">I’ve fixed it</a>.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 21, 2014 </span><br> There was a typo in one of the definitions of the second problem. It has been fixed. Thanks to Haley for pointing this out to me.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 18, 2014 </span><br> The second problem set is now available on the <a href="./assignments.html">assignments</a> page. It is due on September 30.</p>
<p><span class="post-date">September 15, 2014 </span><br> There is a typo in the last problem of the <a href="https://moodle.umass.edu/pluginfile.php/778483/mod_resource/content/2/595F.pset1.pdf">first problem set</a>. If you figured out what the typo is, you will get bonus points. But if you did not, or if you found yourself unable to prove what I asked you to, you will not be penalized. Thanks to Patrick for pointing this out to me.</p>
